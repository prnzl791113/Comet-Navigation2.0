# Comet Navigation
Our augmented reality application leads the way by providing users with an engaging experience while navigating the University of Texas at Dallas (UTD) campus.

At the heart of our applications functionality is its accurate tracking of users' real-time location, made possible by the capabilities of Niantic World Positioning System (WPS). WPS enables our application to get accurate world-scale visual localization in any location, without using VPS. We can achieve advanced navigation features only possible with this more precise location.

A standout feature of our application is its integration with UTD's API, which offers information on building layouts, room locations, and other essential navigation data. By utilizing this API our application generates routes to users' intended destinations, including invidual indoor rooms. This smooth integration ensures that users receive timely navigation guidance, reducing confusion and minimizing time spent searching for places. What distinguishes our AR application is its dedication to providing a navigation experience tailored to UTD. Our application utilizes the UTD API to generate detailed routes using a custom navigation backend. We strageically place invisible anchors into the world corresponding to points on the route, and draw a line across the ground to guide users along the route.

Looking ahead our app is ready for growth and improvement. We plan to integrate mapping services into our UI for more accurate navigation instructions and additional location information. We could suggest and highlight dining options, campus landmarks, and more. Additionally, we will collect ongoing input from users to guide our development process to ensure that the app evolves alongside user expectations and advancements in technology.
